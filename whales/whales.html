    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p>
      Wikipedia tells us this about <strong>whales:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>

      Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf
      sperm whale to the 34 metres (112 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale,
       which is also the largest creature on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism,
       in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs
       that are modified into flippers. Though not as flexible or agile as seals, whales can go
       at incredibly fast speeds, up to 20 knots. Balaenopterids (rorquals) use their throat pleats
        to expand their mouth to take in huge gulps of water.[5] Balaenids have huge heads that can
        make up 40% of their body mass to take in huge amounts of water.[6] Odontocetes have conical
         teeth designed for catching fish or squid. Mysticetes have a well developed sense of "smell",
         whereas Odontocetes have well-developed sensesâ€”their hearing that
         is adapted for both air and water, and can survive even if they're blind.
          Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer
          of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

      bu I like whales beacuse they are:

    <h1>Whale Anatomy</h1>
    <p>
      There are some key parts....
    </p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Blowhole: </strong>WIn cetology, a blowhole is the hole at the top of a
         cetacean's head through which the animal breathes air. It is homologous with the nostril
         of other mammals. As whales reach the water surface to breathe, they will forcefully expel
         air through the blowhole. Not only is air expelled, but so are mucus and carbon dioxide
         from the animal's metabolism, which have been stored in the whale while diving. The exhalation
          is released into the comparably lower-pressure, colder atmosphere, and any water vapor
          condenses. This spray, known as the blow, is often visible from far away as a white splash,
           which can also be caused by water resting on top of the blowhole.</li>
      <li><strong>Ears: </strong>Whales and dolphins had land-based ancestors that made their
         way into the ocean millions of years ago. Part of that transition involved modifying
         their ears so that they could clearly hear sounds underwater and tell where they were
         coming from, says Nick Pyenson, curator of fossil mammals at Smithsonian's National
          Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. (Read about whale evolution in National
          Geographic magazine.)</li>
