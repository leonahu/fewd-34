          Leona takes her homework very seriously. Sometimes she trys to overachieve a little, and she struggles a little more than she expected. But she loves coding in HTML and CSS, it makes
          her feel real good! When she resolves all her confusion in HTML and CSS and she learns all about Javascript, she's gonna fly with
          her design!
