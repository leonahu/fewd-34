          Leona takes her homework very seriously. Sometimes she trys to create a little bit more than she
          was asked to, and she struggles a little bit more than she expected. But she loves coding in HTML and CSS, it makes
          her feel real good! When she resolves all her confusion in HTML and CSS, learns all about Javascript. She's gonna fly with
          her design!
